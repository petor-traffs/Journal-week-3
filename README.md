# Journal-week-3

As usual, the structure of this text is as follows: First, I put the journal of my week first. In this ocasion, I wrote a little thought of this tasks at the end of the journal, so be sure to see it! Then, I put my resumes of the lectures and videos...without any further, enjoy!

## October 12

A new week comes to us! Right now, there’s not much to do, we’re waiting for new emails this week. I talked with my mentor about the new subject of my lightning talk, and he explained to me about SQL. It’s such a vast and very interesting subject! The use of databases, how you can relate most of the data, it’s a great tool to use if you’re surrounded by databases.
I also went to the lightning talks of my teammates, where they talked about:
* Rust Lang.
* SEO. 
* Pair Programming.
* Cryptography.
* Pragmatic Programming.

The preferred for me was the Cryptography one. I’ve always liked the secret messages behind something, just like an example image in the presentation, where it presented a secret code, made by Sherlock Holmes. It has many sub-topics to analyze, and I think all of them have a certain difficulty degree to know. 

## October 13

I had a quick meeting with one of my mentors, where we checked about the presentation. I’m on standby to see if my topic can be presented, or if I have to change it, because they’ll give us some subjects to work on. We received the assignments for this week, so I’ll start to work on that so I get it out of the way sooner!

I’ve started to read the Test Driven Development (TDD) lecture, and it shows how it’s a great way of working towards your objectives. It’s not to do your code and then check it, it’s more about doing the tests that your code may have to affront, and then writing the code. Look at it as if you were the client: you don’t have an instruction manual to use when getting on a new software, so you’ll start doing random things to check if your program works, and that’s where the ideas for tests start to flow.

I also had the opportunity to check on the lightning talks, which were:
* MERN (Combination of many frameworks).
* OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project).
* MVC architecture.
* Git.

The OWASP presentation grabbed most of my attention. Leak of data, broken authentication, are just some of the examples of common risks in the Web. Many actions that you wouldn’t think are risk operations, actually are! I wouldn’t say it as hackers, but “mean” people always look for ways to extract your data, of any kind, so they can see if it’s useful or if they have to keep looking for more valuable information.
The MVC one was also very interesting. The way of how an app can be made, following some series of steps is great to have, so you can sort of have a “template” to work on (similar to having a base).
I believe that the Git one was very informative, I liked to see many examples of how you can use Git to manipulate the repositories. Also, the examples were very explanatory.

## October 14

Again, the day started with a session with my mentor. It was mostly about the code problem that they assigned us for this week. It’s basically a movie recommender. The detail in this problem is that it should run and pass some tests that the repository has. My mentor explained/helped me with some installations of tools that I needed to do the problem. After many attempts to run the code, I finally got the errors that I’m supposed to get with the “main” code. I’m understanding how the code works, and what are the requirements.
Also had the opportunity to get into the lightning talks of my teammates, which were:
* Fail fast.
* Redux.
* Microservices.
* Soft skills importance.
* Social skills for Geeks.
* Agile: How to get started.

The Fail fast one was a “remix” of some of the lectures we already had (it’s not a bad thing). It tells us to fail quickly. Why? Because you’ll learn faster. If failure didn’t exist, how else would we get good bases on learning things? It also helps to easily check where you went wrong.

I also liked the Soft Skills one, because it’s a different angle of what you need to grow. Of course, you need skills in coding and understanding problems, but that’s not it. You also need these skills so you can present ideas, progress in your career, even for a business that you may have in the future! The critical thinking skill was one I didn’t know about. It basically means that you have the ability to relate both the problems or activities in your project, to any of the possible tools that you have at your disposal.
You can work with a mentor, maybe join a group or course, to develop these abilities. Another and very important step to “develop” these abilities are a change of mindset (never think that you can’t). The conclusion of this talk is to have a good balance between the management of the project and the team that you have.





### NOM 035 (Corina Navarro)

This was a very different talk, because it wasn’t only the academy, but almost everyone at Encora. The norm talks about the psychosocial risk factors, referencing the conditions that can lead us to live with stress and anxiety in our workplace. The workplaces must be more sensitive to the emotional needs of their employees, so we must promote a favorable organizational environment in the workplace.

There are many things to consider, but the main ones are that the worker needs a sense of belonging. The training part, so you can have a proper performance is also very important. You can get a great environment when you look for proactive participation and communication between the employees.

Stress is our body’s response to a change. It’s usually not bad or good, it’s a natural thing. It does become a negative thing when we start to face continuous challenges without any type of relief or relaxation. Be aware of this!
An interesting topic in the presentation was the obstaculization of activities. It’s a form of violence, where someone is constantly “making you trip”. It’s amazing how there are many different ways to make a work toxic. I believe most of these are invisible to most of the people in an office.

## October 15

Today I couldn’t meet any of my mentors, luckily, this leaves plenty of room for working on the lectures and videos, besides having one last practice presentation for my Lightning Talk. 
The lecture of “Mocks aren’t Stubs” was like a whole new world for me! So many different techniques, and so many different situations and environments where each of these techniques is useful. Of course, they also have many disadvantages, but it’s up to me to see with which one I’m more comfortable working with.
Between the lecture of Vim and Git, I’d personally stick to Git. Not only because I already started to use it (or perhaps it’s the main reason), but also because the lecture was very well explained. There are many different concepts in the “Git world”, but it also gives us some powerful tool to learn, in the resources topic. I’ll make sure to read and learn at least one of them.
For the videos, I think that the Future of Programming was awesome! It leaves us with a simple, yet powerful message: if you want to be open to new things, to learning things, just say “I don’t know what I’m doing” and you’ll start to look for a way to do it!





### Design Sprint Workshop (Estefania Anaya)

They look to design and care for the software products of Encora to different customers. They look to create a methodology that trains and certifies software development companies.

Design Sprint is simply a structured brainstorm based on design thinking and agile development. Normally, first you have to understand the problem. Then, you define the problems (with investigation), and design sketches for it. With this information, you can get decisions done.
This presentation was cool, different from the typical presentations. We had different dynamics to work as a team, we even brainstormed for an application!! It was to try and make people from Encora to connect easily, especially in this Pandemic time. This “app” was mostly done with the steps that were previously written, so it’s a solid base when trying to make these kind of projects. 

## October 16

The session with one of my mentors was a little brief, but nonetheless, good. We talked about some issues that I had with the programming problem: turns out, the installation of the tools that you need is actually more complicated than I thought! There was a code for movie recommendations that you could do in “5 minutes”...well, maybe the coding part WAS something like 5 minutes, but the installation of the tools was more than that. A problem appeared, I fixed it, and then another problem appeared! Luckily, this little cycle ended, and I could finally run the code for the Recommender. I presented my Lightning Talk, about normalization of Databases, and I think it went great! Now, for the next week, the ignite talk, in 5 minutes...it’s going to be quite a challenge, but I’m excited to do it! 
Nothing much in the day, I merged myself into the BIG programming problem, checking out what I had to do, what steps I had to make. Turns out, it’s “easier” than I thought, but there are many details that I have to check, like how to properly read a GZ file, and how I can pass the data into a csv file. With this, I can start “cleaning” the data, so I can have the information that I need for the program. After that, it’s about counting the product, users, and reviews they’ve made. This is the tricky part, because the second part is about the recommender, and I have the base of the “5 minutes code”.

## Thoughts on the work
I must say...I don’t know if this is a normal programming problem, or if I’m new to this testing coding part, but I think this problem was a proper challenge, because of these and other factors. The fact that I’m not great at Java, and having an enormous amount of information to use, while using new concepts, was a little overwhelming at times. Nevertheless, I got some help from my teammates and the internet, finding and understanding how some things were supposed to be used. I still have a long way to go, but I think this was a great step for me!

## Lectures

### Creating a User-Based Recommender in 5 minutes 

It wasn't a lecture as such, I believe it was more like an instruction manual of how to do a simple code for recommendation of movies. For me, it was interesting to see that in less than 20 lines you can actually create something like that! Of course, the whole process wasn’t easy: as I’ve said before in one of the entries of my journal, installing the required tools and libraries so that the code could identify some of the methods was...let’s say, more than just 5 minutes. Nevertheless, I managed to get the code to work, and after analyzing it, I believe it was easy to understand!

### Test Driven Development 	

In this lecture, they gave us some good tips when going through a code that needs testing. The first of all was to always test your code, so you could make it fail, and thus, you could then write the code to barely pass the test. This helps to remove duplicate code, because you know step by step what you’re adding to your code.
In this section, the lecture shows us an image of some steps to take, which are:

* Test
* Code
* Integrate
* Deploy
* Release
* Steer

This is a cycle, where you first test and then code. Until the coding is good, then you start integrating and keep testing this integration. Then you start deploying and testing, and so on. This cycle helps the code being decoupled (that it’s easy to re-use in future projects).
Now, we go into another series of steps, so you can improve this “style” of coding, where you:

* Think what you want to do.
* Think how you’re going to test it.
* Start writing small tests. Think about the desired API that you want to have.
* Write just enough code to fail the test.
* Run and watch it fail (at least your code is executed).
* Write just enough code to pass the test.
* Run and watch everything pass (if it doesn’t, fix it, since it’s something you’ve just written).
* Reduce duplicated code, aim for expressiveness.
* Repeat all of the above until there’s no more tests you can use.

I believe this is a great way of coding, because you don’t take a step without checking your environment. Even so, we have to be aware that sometimes TDD is not enough. We need to do more than just unit tests. This is because you need to check the “real” requirements, not just the standard ones that the test makes you check. Regarding the security, TDD helps you too. Just like any other functional requirement: you first write tests that will verify functionality, then you have regression testing to make sure that this functionality never gets broken. Thinking about everything huh?

If you do keep going through this TDD style, your tests drive the design of your code (as the name implies), but you’ll also get a nice small set of regression tests that will make the refactor session safer.

### UnitTest

The definition of Unit Test can vary, but there are some common elements: first of all, they focus on a small part of the software system. It’s also written by the programmers with regular tools. Finally, it expects to be significantly faster than other kinds of software. The difference between these definitions is based on what you consider as a unit, although it won’t really matter how you define it.
Here, we have the solitary and sociable test. For me, this was very straightforward, and at first I thought “why not choose just one?” Well, before answering that, I’ll give a small definition. While the solitary test completely isolates the tested unit, the sociable test often relies on other units to fulfill its behavior. About the question of which one should you choose, I believe that depending on your project, one test may fit better than the other, so it’s up to you!
Independently of what kind of test you choose, make sure that it’s small and it’s done by you. A fundamental perk of your test code should be about the velocity. Make it fast, so you can run it frequently (and remember to always check your test after every change).
Remember, you really need a code to run fast, so you don’t get discouraged from running them frequently.

### XUnit

In a short definition, it’s a bunch of testing frameworks that have become widely known amongst software developers. Almost every technology has one! It mainly started with Junit (well, Junit actually made it popular). What XUnit has in particular is that people can control their own environment, having each individual/team build the framework themselves.

These last 3 lectures (TDD, UnitTest and XUnit) were very interesting, although at first it was difficult to read them, because it has many definitions that are new to me! While TDD makes the path to this new style of coding, Unit and X focus on “substyles” of it. I believe that these 2 are more similar than I believe. What I mean with this is that at the end of the day, all the tests made for different programs are made by people. The difference may remain in the “culture” that these people have. The example I’m going to write is something I already said before: if you make the tests for your specific program, it may pass them, and you would think it’s good enough! This in theory, because in the practice there are different situations that your test didn’t include. If the person who is writing the code has a more expanded vision, and sees different situations that may occur in real life, it could give his code that extra advantage to have a better decoupled feature.

### Mocks aren’t Stubs

My preferred lecture of this author. First, we need some definitions of these 2 things. Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what’s programmed in for the test. Mocks are objects pre-programmed with expectations, which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive.

Given that definition, mocks are special case objects that mimic real objects for testing, and it enables a different style of testing. Mocks and stubs are different in how the results are verified and how’s the way of testing and design.

We’ll keep differencing these, so there’s no doubt. The stubs use MOSTLY state verification, which you have the object under testing perform a certain operation, after being supplied with all the necessary collaborators. When it ends, you examine the state of the object, and verify it is the expected one.
The mocks use behavior verification, where you specify exactly which methods are to be invoked on the collaborators by the System Under Test (SUT), verifying not that the ending state is correct, but that the sequence of steps performed was correct.
Whatever style of test you use, you must combine it with coarse grained acceptance tests that operate across the system as a whole.

Personally for me, as a novice, I can’t see a clear difference between these 2, but as the lecture says, you can’t judge a technique without trying it seriously.

### Java Build Tools: How Dependency Management Works with Maven, Gradle and Ant + Ivy  

The dependency management is used for centralizing dependency information. You can put all information in the common POM, so you get simpler references. Also, you can control the versions of artifacts used in transitive dependencies.
The lecture tells us about the definitions of dependencies, where you can add a tuple of the group-id, artifact-id and requested version to dependencies section of the buildscript: the build searches for the dependencies, by looking in its local and remote-defined repositories. It’s also great to get a newer version of the library without having to change your buildscript (Be aware that this may cause troubles). 
All of these tools is so that you can work efficiently, making the use of this Dependency Management a must for everyone who has projects with maven, for example (With the programming problem of this week, I’m thankful that this helped me configure mi IDE the correct way, so I could run my own codes).

### Missing semester: Editors (Vim)

It is said that Vim is the most popular command-line-based editor, though I’m not sure why. Just by checking the description of the lecture made me want to never touch something like this. Of course, my perspective may change while I get deeper and deeper into this programming world.
Basically, what “scared” me was the following: avoid using the mouse, because it’s too slow. Also, it avoids using the arrow keys, because it's too much movement. Of course, it has other “perks”, like you can have different modes for inserting text vs manipulating text (another feature that would make me run).
The lecture gives us the different operating modes, which involve Normal, Insert, Replace, Visual and Command-line. Here, there are different meanings in different operating modes.
I know that it tries to make me see just how good Vim is (which probably really is good), but I’ll personally stick with the beginning of the lecture: you need to invest time mastering an editor that fits your needs. It also tells us a series of steps to do this last phrase, BUT, it tells us to fully commit to using this new program that you may have, so you can improve massively.
The series of steps are these: Start with a tutorial, and stick with using your editor for all your texting needs. You also need to put some thinking into this process, by looking things up as you go. In other words, if it seems like there should be a better way to do something, there probably is!

### Missing semester: Version Control (Git)

Ah, something more known for me, Git! The Version Control System (VCS) are tools used to track changes to source code. It helps maintain a history of changes and facilitate collaboration.
When you start working in this kind of environment, you can see it’s useful like a journal, because it helps you look at old snapshots of a project, it keeps a log of changes, and it keeps parallel branches of development.
Git is normally the “Defacto” standard for version control. Remember, a good version control is one where it has an ugly interface (yes, somethings need to be memorized) BUT it has a beautiful design (meaning that it can be understood).
It tells us some great basic commands, while also explaining about branching and merging, working on remotes and undoing commands.
There are a lot of different concepts...luckily, there’s a “ProGit” resource; it’ll teach me most of what I need to use Git proficiently!






## Videos

### Pale Blue Dot 

We’re so small, a mere fraction of a dot in the universe. This dot is the only thing we’ve ever known, so why would we waste our life arguing and fighting with the person right next to us? 
We shouldn’t put our attention on human cruelty, we should put it on human kindness. If we can protect this kindness, we may be able to protect what everyone has in common, our “home dot”. So...look past differences!!

### The future of programming 

This was a great video. The format of the presentation, making it look like a spokesperson from the 60’s was a great detail! Talking about how there would be a state and behavior verification, how code would be made, even a so called “Global Network” (basically the internet). It begins with telling us that technology changes quickly, it’s the people’s minds that change so slow!
It goes then to the spatial representation, how it’s the future of the programs, and how you could manage to represent information in a “spatial form”.
Of course, the video goes on with this 60’s vision of the future, many different examples on how things will change. Reality is that, alright, there have been changes, but some basic things, remain the same!
It would scare a lot if we would still use the way of coding, procedures, text dumping and the sequential style of the 60’s. But you know what would be scarier? That we FORGET these ideas: remember the “everything is a remix” video? This is the exact same point in this video. There are the bases for new, interesting ideas, we just have to keep looking for them! You may ask “then what was all that 60’s style all about”, well...If we didn’t have this culture of basing our ideas on old ones, so we could improve the concept of something, we would rapidly get stuck. 
If we got in front of guys coding in the 60’s, and showed them an IDE (for example), telling them “hey, this will improve your coding”, they would just laugh and return to their coding plaques! They would say “this works” and would not want to change something. That’s why it’s frightening to think that we could lose the BASE of so different concepts, we would go back to square 1.
A dangerous thought of this is to think that you know what you’re doing, because it’ll make you stop looking for more ways to improve, new ideas to check.
Remember, if you want to be open to things, and apply the last phrase, just say “I don’t know what I’m doing”.

### Inventing on principle

This wasn’t a video to explain about the principle of the author, no. It was more about finding your own principle...but what is a principle, and what principle should I have? Both questions kind of get the same answer. First of all, in a work, you always get told to “follow a passion”, but this may be wrong after so many years of listening to it. What you should do is follow a principle, and what is a principle? It’s something that feels right.
We’ll get to this point, because I want to show the principle of the author, which is that creators need a connection with what they’re creating. You can’t create something if you can’t see changes. You must be able to check your ideas, and thus, check the results. Just wanted to tell that inspiration from the author.
Now, again with the principle part...it’s fighting the right vs wrong, or fighting for a cause. A cause that can make you feel complete. A principle is a form of self discovery, what you want to stand for. Be aware, it can take long before you find it.
Last but not least, if you’re having questions of whether you've found a correct principle, then ask yourself the next question: “Does my principle have some sort of insight?” If the answer is yes, you’re good to go! You’ll know you’re doing something right.

### Machine learning - google 

I was amazed by this series of videos, mainly because it looks so simple!! When I was in college, sometimes the concept of Machine Learning (ML) popped into the talk. It was a “rare” concept, so looking at it with the perspective that the video gives us is just astonishing. It makes you feel that you can start in this path, and that it’s going to be alright!
You can start with just 6 lines of code to begin ML (another astonishing discovery for me). We have to know that ML is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence, where it learns through examples and experience. It uses a classifier, which is a function where you find patterns in examples. The recipe to making a Classifier is collecting training data, something that describes the data (features). You can represent these with Bucketing, Crossing, Hashing and Embedding.
You then need to make a train classifier: here, you make a Decision Tree. In other words, you create a box of rules. After all of this, you start making predictions with your algorithm!
To get right your ML code, you need to know:
* How does this work in the real world?
* How much training data you need.
* How is the tree created.
* What makes a good feature.

Talking about the last 2 points of these, you need to know that your tree asks questions of your features: the better your features, the better your tree. Classifiers are as good as their features. Now, with this in mind, there are more tips for your features:
* It should be Informative.
* It should be Independent.
* It should be simple.

You don’t need a whole list of features, you just need the minimum features to solve the problem. In the long run, we want  our classifier that learns more complex relationships between the features.


I was impressed with the main subjects where this can work, like the classification of images and handwritten digits. I believe that using these algorithms will create an incredible App, that helps with so many problems that require logic, coming from a computer at least.

### Moonshot Thinking 

This moonshot concept is to look for a clearly defined and complicated problem. It needs to be ambitious, exploratory, and ground-breaking.
I’m not going to focus on that, but rather on the secret for success in this kind of project. The author tells us the “10x thinking” secret, where basically it’s easier to do something 10 times better than do something 10% better….quite rare right? You would think that by focusing on something smaller, you could get a better result from it. But no, it’s this kind of mentality that most of the companies have, and it has a terrible ongoing cycle where they can’t get out. If you want to be radically better (10x better), then have my back, make sure you’ll support me through this project. Also, you need to know that I will fail, and I will fail quickly, so I can try new stuff! Companies nowadays don’t do that, they just want results. They just look for small  improvements so they can keep control of things. If you fail, they see it as if you were a miserable person that just made them waste their money and time. This mentality is hard to get out of it, so be careful.
As a conclusion, remember this: if you aim for the 10x, and end up with 2x, it’s totally fine, it’s great!! Having such an improvement is always hard to get, but be aware that it’s always better than the little 10%.

### Fast Company Exclusive: Inside Google X 

This video complements a lot of the ideas of the last one. It ads and remarks the following though: Experiments look for knowledge, not success!! This is another reason why companies don’t have the correct mentality. They lose the real objective of trying things, and it’s about understanding what you’re doing! You start seeing that companies like Google have a correct mentality, where if there’s a project with a different company, they’ll warn about the searching of knowledge. Also, they’ll warn about the time, because this is a slow process, and the result may not look like much at first, but it’s part of this learning curve. You won’t get it right at first, so you have to discard the wrong ideas!

### La mejor presentación de tu vida

Sorry, that’s the title of the video, but worry not, the written part will be in english. This presentation was so “alternative”, the way it was conducted was very special. Also, it gives us a powerful message of improving every single time we have the chance.
Presentations are normally very important, because you give a background and a “frontground” of your work. What normally happens when you give a presentation? You get nervous of screwing something up. To avoid this, simply think what you’re looking to get to your audience, NOT what’s happening in your head.
Your audience has 2 parts, the thinking part and the feeling part. For the thinking part, you need to know the exact amount of knowledge that you’re giving. It can’t be too much, or you’ll lose them. It can’t be small information either, because they’ll process it quickly and lose interest. You need something that makes your brain think the minimum, but constantly. With that, you’ll make sure that they process the information and then ask for more, thus, putting attention. Telling about your subject it’s also about explaining why it’s useful to have that information. And using a famous phrase, less is more...simplify what you can!
For the feeling part, it’s great to make people participate, that makes them feel good about it. Here, you can also congratulate them for their participation. You also need to gestionate the rhythm, and employ emphasis through different parts of the presentation.
Of course, this part is about feelings, so you would think about putting yours on the line...short answer, do it! Show your emotions, it may affect the way you’re presenting something for the good!


### What Got You Here Won't Get You There: How Successful People Become Even More Successful

Success is something delusional, though it is not something bad! Normally, people who are successful tend to become coaches or managers of a team. You can construct your own attitude towards success, if you follow some good tips that this video tells us. Some annoying habits that you want to avoid are:
* Winning too much (almost everything becomes a competition).
* Adding too much value (for example, you have a main idea, and someone gives you an advice to improve it. You feel that your idea is not yours anymore, so you don’t want to execute it).
* Telling the world how smart you are (boring and makes you look like an idiot).
* Passing judgment (especially avoid this with your teammates).

When you start seeing something wrong with a member of your team, do not try to tell them to change EVERYTHING you’re seeing. They’ll probably forget about the improvements they must make, and end up doing nothing. If you want to change, change something, not everything (one thing at a time). Talking about this section, you must make sure that the person you want to help WANTS to change, otherwise you’ll end up losing energy and time with them.
Now for your own improvements. Always listen to suggestions without judging, or you’ll have a wall that doesn’t let you see a great idea, even if it’s in front of you.
Also, always try to learn and help as much as you can.
For a coach, try to take your role more lightly, so you can start making it fun for everyone! Also, be aware of the next, because it tends to be a popular opinion when using advice. If an advice doesn’t work in your own context, don’t use it. Advice is not meant to work the same for everyone.
Finally, do not focus on what you don’t have: focus instead on what you do have! And always have fun! If you don’t have fun with what you’re doing, you’re in the wrong place.


### Quantum computers explained - Limits of human technology/ Google and NASA's Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab/ Dr Quantum - Double Slit Experiment/ Measure for Measure: Quantum Physics and Reality/ The Quantum Conspiracy: What Popularizers of QM Don't Want You to Know  

I’ll be honest here: I gathered all of these title videos into one, simply because I couldn’t understand almost anything from their content. I believe that I only “understood” the animation one, with Dr. Quantum...so yeah, that tells you something right? Anyhow, I’ll try to write coherent things here.

The biggest upgrade that we’ll ever see are our brains. The problem with this is that we’re reaching limitations when trying to expand this upgrade to other sections. Mainly, the computers. While the computer parts are getting smaller, we start to see a physical barrier: quantum physics acts differently than our normal behavior. Of course, it’s faster, but it also makes the bits work differently, with something called superposition (I believe that is when an atom can behave as 2 different atoms.
Sadly, this quantum physics puts EVERYTHING into question, of how we understand the most basic of things can change in that world!  In all of the videos, they explain (or try to explain) the same example, of the double slit. It basically tells us about how an electron can behave both as an atom and as a wave. It also tells us that when trying to measure HOW it’s going to behave, this act of measuring makes the electron behave in a specific matter, making it incomplete. In other words, when no one measures, a particle can be anywhere. When you measure, the particle can go into one position.
This now is a personal opinion. I believe that the Measure for Measure is a great video, you can see how excited the people in front are to try and explain such a complex subject.
In reality, I think that no one truly understands quantum mechanics to a perfection state. At first, I didn’t know what the presenter was talking about...then I thought that neither the presenter knows what he’s talking about.
It lifts so many questions, like if our classical universe is not real, but rather if there’s a quantum universe, where it contains an infinite collection of classical universes. 
The worst thing of all? Everything has an explanation… we just don’t know how to get to that explanation.

That's it for this week. Any questions?? You know where to find me!!
